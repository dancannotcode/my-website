          Hi, I'm Daniel Ortega. I create cool projects to make life more exciting. 
          I am a UnderGraduate from California State University, EastBay. When I am not at 
          work, I am mostly working on projects and learning about new technologies. I live 
          in San Leandro, California, where I enjoy video games, working out, and sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have diverse skills, ranging from Python, R, Java, OOP, SQL databases, and System
           design. I am passionate about finding insight that has never been discovered before
            and leading to new questions.
